# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on website design based on mockups for the local business

**Thoughts:** I really struggled initially to get things aligned manually, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I decided to add in Materialize CSS for some nice looking components and then customizing them to my layout and color pallete.

### Day 1: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So far, implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox as well as added images and styling including Materialize CSS helpful components. Now, my navbar contains a dropdown as well as a logo for the business. Looking forward to adding dynamic transitions between the sections as well as refining the typography and color scheme.

**Thoughts:** Need to fix nav behavior and make sure jquery code is efficently affecting page transitions. Things I need to learn include some extra jQuery functions or the vanilla JS alternatives. Other things include bringing in existing content from the site to my own version.

### Day 2: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on JS basic algorithms as well as learning more in depth concepts such as hoisting, closures, etc. Also, need to go over a couple tutorials on AJAX/requests to be able to hook up API's to applications I want to work on. Finally, will try to leverage my design knowledge and resources to create a clean site from scratch that's also mobile friendly.

### Day 3: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS algorithms further as well as coding a couple projects via Traversy's Youtube channel. Got a weight converter and address book type app to work within the browser via Vanilla JS as well as some HTML/CSS magic including Materialize. Brainstormed ideas for my next front end project. Will do a quote generator using React/Materialize as well as a component library, figure out an API to fetch data from and feed the app. Next will continue with Udemy course's weather app leveraging React and Redux.

### Day 3: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React app and finishing up basic JS algorithms. It was a more difficult endeavor but I ended up learning new methods such as call(), charAt(), using the Boolean argument, and nested for loops. App is on its way to completion upon some general fixes and addition of state and usage of AJAX/Fetch to be done as soon as I find a quote source.

**Thoughts:** Get help with algorithms and data structures and start the Udemy course as well. Work on Responsive site again next and include interactive functionality. Start deploying new version of Portfolio. Will need to upload via FTP and implement routing for the PHP/ form content.

### Day 8: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: At this mid month point, I've gotten deep into algorithm problems and the Udacity full stack nanodegree. Learned Python classes, methods, constructors and how to set up inheritance between classes. Next up, coding project for a movie trailer site to leverage server-side code to display movie trailers and information.

**Thoughts:** Need input on Algo's and have to practice a bit with Python code to get the site done
