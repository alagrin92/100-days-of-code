# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on website design based on mockups for the local business

**Thoughts:** I really struggled initially to get things aligned manually, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I decided to add in Materialize CSS for some nice looking components and then customizing them to my layout and color pallete.

### Day 1: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So far, implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox as well as added images and styling including Materialize CSS helpful components. Now, my navbar contains a dropdown as well as a logo for the business. Looking forward to adding dynamic transitions between the sections as well as refining the typography and color scheme.

**Thoughts:** Need to fix nav behavior and make sure jquery code is efficently affecting page transitions. Things I need to learn include some extra jQuery functions or the vanilla JS alternatives. Other things include bringing in existing content from the site to my own version.
