# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on website design based on mockups for the local business

**Thoughts:** I really struggled initially to get things aligned manually, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I decided to add in Materialize CSS for some nice looking components and then customizing them to my layout and color pallete.
